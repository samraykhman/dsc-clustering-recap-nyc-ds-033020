    "\n",
    "The key takeaways from this section include:\n",
    "* There are two main types of clustering algorithms: non-hierarchical clustering (k-means) and hierarchical agglomerative clustering\n",
    "* You can quantify the performance of a clustering algorithm using metrics such as variance ratios\n",
    "* When working with the k-means clustering algorithm, it is useful to create elbow plots to find an optimal value for $k$\n",
    "* When using hierarchical agglomerative clustering, different linkage criteria can be used to determine which clusters should be merged and at what point\n",
    "* Dendrograms and clustergrams are very useful visual tools in hierarchical agglomerative clustering \n",
    "* Advantages of k-means clustering include easy implementation and speed, whereas the main disadvantage is that it isn't always straightforward how to pick the \"right\" value for $k$ \n",
    "* Advantages of hierarchical agglomerative clustering include easy visualization and intuitiveness, whereas the main disadvantage is that the result is very distance-metric-dependent\n",
    "* You can use supervised and unsupervised learning together in a few different ways. Applications of this are look-alike models in market segmentation and semi-supervised learning\n"
